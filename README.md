# TempSedRouting
This package introduces a new high temporal resolution suspended sediment routing model that integrates fine sediment deposition and re-entrainment processes of individual size fractions with suspended sediment transport throughout the river network. 
It use a hudrological model as a force. 
The input data from hydrological model are: flow (m3/s), unit flow (m2/s) and water depth (m) at each time step and each section of the river network throughout the study catchment.
